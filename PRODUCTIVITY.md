## limit social media as much as possible
- delete Instagram/Facebook/TikTok (the most addicting)
  - contract someone else out to post on them/make content
- leave Twitter (useful to business). However, only post once a week and write post in Apple Notes
- use anonymous Discord for testing/chatting. Only use main Discord when I need to check/talk to someone. Discord wastes a lot of time.
