# Productivity

## limit social as much as possible

- delete Instagram/Facebook/TikTok (the most addicting)
  - contract someone else out to post on them/make content
- leave Twitter (useful to business). However, only post once a week and write post in Apple Notes
- use anonymous Discord for testing/chatting. Only use main Discord when I need to check/talk to someone. Discord wastes a lot of time.
- use [Raycast focus](https://www.raycast.com/core-features/focus) to block iMessage

> [!NOTE]  
> Completely eliminating all communication apps, including iMessage, from a laptop is tempting but impractical. Investors or clients may use iMessage to communicate. You could separate work and personal communication by using `email` on iMessage for work and `cellphone` on iMessage for personal. However, this can cause issues if a business contact has your cell number and continues to use it for work-related messages. Sending an iMessage to them with email does not seem to always transfer to their reply being to your email. This needs further exploration.

## eat the frog first
