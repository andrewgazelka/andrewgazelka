Hello, I'm Andrew 👋🏼. Please email me for my resume or for general inquiries: `andrew (dot) gazelka (at) gmail (dot) com` 

I'm currently a full stack developer with [@eitmn](https://github.com/eitmn) (contract for United Health Group and similarly sized companies), but I also enjoy other fields such as machine learning and parallel computing. Although I am mostly self-taught, I am majoring in CSCI and expect to recieve my degree from University of Minnesota in spring 2021.

A few things I ❤️ that you should look at!
