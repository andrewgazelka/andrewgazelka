Hello, I'm Andrew 👋🏼 and my email is `andrew (dot) gazelka (at) gmail (dot) com` 

I'm currently a full stack developer, but I also enjoy other fields such as machine learning and parallel computing. Although I am mostly self-taught, I am majoring in CSCI and expect to recieve my degree from University of Minnesota in spring 2021.

A couple things I ❤️ that you should learn about!
-   <img src=".github/kotlin.png" alt="Kotlin Emoji" width="15"> [Structured concurrency](https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/)
- 🦀 [Memory ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html)

The classes I am currently taking are:
- 💻 Computer Graphics
- 📷 Computer Vision
- 🧠 Machine Learning
