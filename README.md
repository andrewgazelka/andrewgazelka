I consider myself competent in:

|Topic|List|
|--------|-----|
|Languages|Kotlin, Rust, C(++), Dart, Go, Python, JS/TS, Java|
|Frameworks|Angular, Flutter, NestJS|
|Databases|MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, MongoDB, Redis|

What I am learning independently
- Haskell (I love immutability and FP!)
- GPU programming
- ReasonML (OCaml variant) with React

Projects I've worked on that have cool visuals:

|Project|Description|Demonstration|
|--------|-----|-------|
|[ezAuton](https://github.com/ezAuton/ezAuton/)|A library for autonomous vehicle navigation I made in my junior & senior years of high school. Uses Java and Kotlin.|![ezAuton](.github/ezAuton.gif)|
|[OneShotMC](https://youtu.be/XD1uop6fzR8)|My former Minecraft server I developed/created, which had over 100k unique joins. Uses a bunch of Kotlin, Java, and for web applications uses a little bit of TypeScript/Python/JavaScript.|![OneShotMC](.github/osmc.gif)|
|[Ray tracer](https://github.com/andrewgazelka/csci5607-proj3)|A project for my computer graphics class made in C++|![RayTracer](.github/raytracer.png)|
|[TSP Solver](https://github.com/andrewgazelka/SimulatedAnnealing)|A rather simple project, but it is really pretty! This uses Kotlin, TornadoFX (JavaFX extension), and simulated annealing to solve the traveling sales person problem.|![Simulated Annealing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7644264/114594706-27ddd480-9c53-11eb-9999-af75e5de79c4.gif)|
|[Rust OpenStreetMap](https://github.com/andrewgazelka/RustOpenStreetMap)|A pathfinding library that uses parallel bi-direcitonal A* to find shortest paths in Minnesota. Uses custom low-memory `Vec` implementation and message passing. Can find any path in an average time of 3.5ms. The picture shows the paths generated from running with 1000 random start-end pairs.|![Rust OSM](https://github.com/andrewgazelka/RustOpenStreetMap/blob/master/.github/bda.png)|

**Most of my web/app development (JS/TS/Flutter/Angular/NestJS) is private! Please contact me if you want an overview!!**
